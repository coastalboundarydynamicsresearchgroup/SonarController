# Sonar Controller Computer for Oregon State Ice Ocean 881a

The 881a sonar controller for the Oregon State Ice Ocean group is a pressure vessel with self-contained battery power and a control computer with a communication port appropriate to talk to the Imagenex 881a sonar.

This document focuses on the unboxing and setup of the control computer.  Issues of pressure vessel selection, mounting, battery power, etc, are left for other documents.

## Components
The sonar control computer hardware consists of:

Connect an HDMI monitor, wired Ethernet connection, and USB keyboard and mouse.  The installation will require an internet connection provided over wired Ethernet.

### Power up

Connect the power supply that came with the SBC to the wall and the USB C connector.  This is for setup and development only.  When deployed, the USB C connector will be powered with a buck converter running off battery power.

Depress the power button (tiny stud near the HDMI connector) momentarily.

Observe the LEDs near the USB end of the SBC blink occasionally during boot.

The LattePanda logo should come on the monitor for a few seconds.

The SBC should boot to Windows 10 Professional

### Enable Boot on Power Up

If Windows is running, reboot.  If not, power-up the SBC, remembering to press the power button to start booting.

During the boot process, press the Delete to enter the BIOS.

On the Advanced tab, scroll down to Power management, and press Enter.  Find Boot on AC, and turn it on.

Finish booting, then shut down.  Test by removing USB power from the SBC, then re-attaching the USB power connector.  You should boot directly into Windows.

### Install Linux from USB drive

Obtain the ISO image for the Linux distro.  I used Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server from August 3, 2023.  I have burned the ISO to a USB drive which should be included.

If you do not have my USB drive, or wish to use a different or newer Linux distro, download and use Balena Etcher or some other tool to burn the image.  
-  Note that simply copying the ISO file to a pre-formatted thumb drive will not work. 
-  The USB drive needs to have at least a capacity equal to the size of the ISO image.
-  Burning the image completely erases all other information on the drive.
-  Ubuntu comes with a tool called ‘Startup Disk Creator’ that works like Balena Etcher for this purpose, if you are creating the installation USB drive on an existing Ubuntu system.

Using either my USB drive or your newly-created one, insert the USB drive into one of the USB slots on the LattePanda 3 Delta SBC.  If windows is running, you may see a popup that says you need to format the drive in order to use it. ***don’t***.  Just dismiss the dialog.

Reboot the SBC.  While rebooting, press Delete to enter the BIOS.  On the Boot tab:
- Change the boot type from UEFI to Legacy
- Change the boot order so that first boot is from the USB drive.  Exit the BIOS to boot from the USB drive.
  - NOTE that you will need an Ethernet cable connected, with Internet access.

Booting from USB may be slower than other methods, so be patient.  You should see a long list of notes as Linux talks to itself during the boot process.

Most of the first configuration questions about keyboard and such are obvious, just press Enter to accept them.  However, I had an issue when I got to a page requesting a network adapter to use during installation.  Apparently, my DHCP was not acceptable to the boot program, and it kept resetting the network adapter, showing an IP address, then rapidly resetting to ‘Disabled’.  Rinse, repeat.  I found that I could use the arrow keys to put the cursor on the adapter, and get a side menu, allowing me to configure the network by hand.  For my network, I used an unused IP address: 
-  Net mask -> 192.168.1.0/24  
-  IP address -> 192.168.1.57  
-  Gateway -> 192.168.1.1  
-  DNS servers -> 1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8  
-  Search URL -> google.com
  - Note that for your network, none of the above manual configuration may be necessary, if the network adapter acquires an IP address reliably.  Also, the example Net mask, IP address, and Gateway above were appropriate for my network, but may not be for yours.  If unsure, you may be able to check with a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer that is properly working on your network.  Use the settings from that, but change the IP address to an unused one.

The installer then used the network connection to download some stuff.

The installer found the LattePanda built-in EMMC storage, but the M.2 drive was not mounted.  So, it offered to install Linux on the whole drive where Windows is currently installed (overwriting Windows).  Which is what I wanted.  I just pressed Enter to allow this.

At this point, you will be presented with a screen asking for your name, the server name, a username, and password (confirmed).  Here is what I suggest using:
-  Your name: &lt;your name&gt;
-  Your server’s name: 881controller&lt;N&gt;  where &lt;N&gt; is 1,2,3, etc, making unique names.
-  Username: sonar881
-  Password: 881

On the next screen, don’t upgrade to Ubuntu Pro.

On the screen asking about SSH, enable SSH, but do not import any keys.

On the screen offering different server environments, choose Docker.

When installation is done, select Done.  It may fail to eject a CD, then ask you to remove your USB drive and press Enter.  Do that.

Reboot the SBC.  While rebooting, press Delete to enter the BIOS.  On the Boot tab:
- Change the boot type back to UEFI from Legacy
- Change the boot order so that first boot is from the Hard drive, which in UEFI mode should show that it boots to Linux.  Exit the BIOS to boot from the internal EMMC SSD.

The SBC should reboot into Linux.  

### Format the NVMe SSD storage and make a filesystem

Fresh out of the box, the M.2 NVMe drive will be initialized, with no partitions.  Our first job is to create a partition.  If you are re-using an M.2 drive for some reason, this step may already be done.

Make the partition on the M.2 NVMe drive. 

Execute:
`lsblk`


![lsblk command](lsblkNVMeSSD.jpg)

Most likely, your NVMe drive will show up like mine: `/dev/nvme0n1`

To make the partition, execute (using the drive path found from lsblk):

`sudo fdisk /dev/nvme0n1`
- Choose `n` to create a new partition.
- At the prompt, choose `p` for a primary partition.
- Select `1`.
- Other questions will follow, just use defaults.
- When back at the main command, choose `w` to write the data to the disk.

Add a filesystem to the partition.  I am choosing `ntfs` since it will provide portability to directly read and write to the SSD if it is removed from this SBC and put into a Windows computer.  Other formats might be preferrable in a strictly-linux environment.

Use lsblk again to see the name of the partition you just created.  It is probably named `/dev/nvme0n1p1`.  Make the filesystem with this command.

`sudo mkfs -t ntfs /dev/nvme0n1p1`


### Permanently mount the NVMe M.2 SSD

- Log in as `sonar881` (password `881`).
- Create a mount point.  This will be used in `fstab` below, and will be where you see the data for this drive:

`sudo mkdir /mnt/m2`

- At the command prompt, enter:

`sudo blkid`

![blkid command](blkid_command.png)

- Look for the partition you created above, probably `/dev/nvme0n1p1` or `/dev/nvme0n1p2`.  Somewhere in the line for this partition, should be `UUID=”32BA153FBA1500D1”`.  Your UUID will of course be different, but will be some long string of Hex digits.  Highlight the UUID (less quotation marks) and copy.

- Now, edit `/etc/fstab`.  To do this, enter:

`cd /etc`

`sudo nano fstab`

At the bottom, enter a line like

`UUID=32BA153FBA1500D1 /mnt/m2       ntfs-3g   auto,users,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=027,fmask=137,utf8  0  0`

- Note that the string of hex digits following ‘UUID=’ must be the UUID you captured from the blkid command above.
- Exit the editor, saving the file, and test it with

`sudo mount -a`

- Issuing a new lsblk command should show the mount point `/mnt/m2` for the partition you mounted, and you should see a file or two at `/mnt/m2`.

![lsblk command](lsblk_command.png)

-Try creating a subfolder and writing a file.

### Enable Wifi hotspot

- Log in as `sonar881` (password `881`).
- At the command prompt, enter:

`sudo apt install network-manager`

`[sudo] password for sonar881: 881`

- After installation is complete, enter

`nmcli d`

- You should receive several lines, one of which will indicate that `wlo1`, type `wifi`, is disconnected.  The point of this line is to confirm the name of the wifi network connection (`wlo1` in the example above).  If yours is different, remember to insert it into the commands below).

- Enable the wifi hotspot with

`sudo nmcli d wifi hotspot ifname wlo1 ssid Sonar1 password Sonar881`

- Re-entering `nmcli d` command should now show the wifi hotspot connected:

![nmcli d command](nmcli_command.png)

You should also see a hotspot called Sonar881 visible to your laptop, phone, or tablet.  Don't connect to it yet; we are not done.

Log into the SBC and change to the network-manager directory that controls the hotspot:

`cd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections`

`ls -al`

When you instructed network-manager to create a hotspot above, it wrote a file in this directory called `Hotspot.nmconnection`.  Edit this file:

`sudo nano Hotspot.nmconnection`

Edit or create the `[ipv4]` section as needed so it looks like this:

![Hotspot.nmconnection edit](Hotspot.nmconnection.png)


The third digit in the IP addresses on the `address1` line should be unique for each controller SBC.  This will allow you to run more than one in the same local area without conflict.  Example: `10.42.1.1, 10.42.2.1, 10.42.3.1`, etc.

To make the above change take effect, restart the network-manager service:

`sudo service NetworkManager restart`

and then re-issue the manual hotspot command:

`sudo nmcli d wifi hotspot ifname wlo1 ssid Sonar1 password Sonar881`


The above procedure is a proof of concept, not a permanent solution, because it requires you to enable the wifi hotspot manually after every boot.  To enable the wifi hotspot automatically on every boot, we will create a cron job that runs on startup.  The cron job will run a shell script, so we need to provide that as well.

- Note that the script files required for several steps come from the git repository, which can be obtained online from github.  To set this up, create a directory for repositories called github:

    `mkdir ~/github`

    Now, change into the `github` directory and clone the repository

    `cd ~/github`

    `git clone https://github.com/LouisRoss/SonarController.git`

    The steps below that reference repository directories are now referenced as if you are starting in `~/github/SonarController`.

- Let's add the shell script first.  This git repository contains three files in the bootfiles/ directory called start-hotspot1.sh, start-hotspot2.sh, and start-hotspot3.sh.  The three files provide unique SSIDs (Sonar1, Sonar2, and Sonar3) for up to three different controllers.  It should be straightforward to extend the pattern for more.  Copy one of these files onto the SBC, changing its name to omit the final digit of the filename.  One way, would be:

`cd bootfiles`

`sudo cp start-hotspot1.sh /usr/local/bin/start-hotspot.sh`

`chmod 744 /usr/local/bin/start-hotspot.sh`

- Now, let's create the cron job to run the script as admin (don't forget the `sudo` here):

`sudo crontab -e`

![crontab starup](crontab-reboot-02.png)

- crontab is a utility for editing the cron job table.  It uses whatever editors are available on the system.  You should probably select nano, since it is the most intuitive.

- When nano starts with the cron job table, use the arrow keys to scroll to the bottom and enter:

`@reboot /usr/local/bin/start-hotspot.sh`

- Use ctrl-X to exit nano, indicating that you want to save.  
- You should now be able to reboot, and confirm, both with `nmcli d` and by browsing available wifi hotspots with your phone or laptop to find `Sonar881`.

### Set Ethernet to Automatically Obtain an IP Address

During installation, it may have been necessary to set the IP address of the wired Ethernet to a fixed IP address in order to make the installer work.  If that was done, now is the time to reset it back to a more generally useful state.  The problem is that with a fixed IP address, the wired Ethernet may not work when taken to another network, such as in the field.

To change the network configuration, we will replace a file generated by the installer with one in our repository.  We will be working in the `/etc/netplan` directory.  The old file is called `00-installer-config.yaml` and we will replace it with `99-ethernet.yaml`.

First, make a backup.

`cd /etc/netplan`

`sudo mkdir backup` (password is `881` if needed)

`sudo cp * backup`

Now, remove the old file.

`sudo rm 00-installer-config.yaml`

Finally, copy the new file.  Here, we assume the git respository is already cloned to `~/github/SonarController`.  See above for instructions if needed.

`cd ~/github/SonarController/bootfiles`

`sudo cp 99-ethernet.yaml /etc/netplan`

To test this, reboot the board:

`sudo shutdown -r now`

After reboot, log back in and check the status of the wired Ethernet device enp2s0:

`ip address show device enp2s0`

You should get an answer something like this:

![ip address](ipaddress.png)

The important things that indicate success are that the state should be UP and there should be a line starting with `inet a.b.c.d/x` showing a reasonable IP address.  You should be able to ssh into the computer using this IP address from another computer on the same network, so you may want to copy the IP address down.

### Clean logs on boot
The flash drive storage on the SBC is not huge (about 50 GB), and after a few weeks of use, can be completely filled with log files.  These files are normal Linux activity, but not needed for the sonar controller, and will render it useless if allowed to fill up.

To address this problem, we install a script that runs every time the computer boots that will delete all log files.

`cd bootfiles`

`scp clear-syslogs.sh sonar881@sonarcontroller1:/home/sonar881/clear-syslogs.sh`

- Log into the SBC and install in the correct directory:

`sudo cp clear-syslogs.sh /usr/local/bin`

`chmod 744 /usr/local/bin/clear-syslogs.sh`

- Now, let's create the cron job to run the script as admin (don't forget the `sudo` here):

`sudo crontab -e`

- When nano starts with the cron job table, use the arrow keys to scroll to the bottom and enter:

`@reboot /usr/local/bin/clear-syslogs.sh`

- Use ctrl-X to exit nano, indicating that you want to save.  

The `sudo` version of crontab should now look like this:

![crontab](crontab1.png)


### Install Docker

SSH or Log in to the controller and enter:

`sudo apt install docker.io`

Then add the user `sonar881` to the `docker` group:

`sudo gpasswd -a sonar881 docker`

And provide the sudo password `881` if required.

Also, install docker Compose:

`mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/`

`curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.20.2/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose`

`chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose`

To verify that the installation was successful, you can run:

`docker compose version`

Confirm the output:

`Docker Compose version v2.20.2`
